    summary: The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized
        set of  statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can
        use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects,
        policy, and environmental changes on community health.

            of food, child care, health insurance, housing, transportation, and other
            necessities. An annualized budget is calculated for 8 different types
            of families (1 adult; 1 adult-1 child; 1 adult-2 children; 1 adult-3 children;
            2 adults; 2 adults-1 child; 2 adults- 2 children; 2 adults-3 children).

            adults with two children) was applied against the income distribution
            of single women with children and married couples with children, respectively.
            The number of families that fell below the living wage, expressed as a
            percentage of all families of that type, is the indicator.
